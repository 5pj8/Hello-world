	<p>One of the projects we did this year was coding using Khan acadamy. We used Khan acadamy to teach us simple code.<br>
	This information was later used to make this website. We also used that information on our Notepad ++ project that wasw also to help make this website.<p/>

<p>App Inventor is a website where you can create apps for android devices. The app I created was an app about learning how to count. It was centered around kids in kindergarten and younger, and it was a fun project. It was a sort of brick building system, with some code still associated.</p>
	
	<h2>GitHub</h2>

	<p>Github is a website dedicated to helping other people create websites and hosting them as well. Github is going to be my second last project for computer science, as python will be my last. This is a great way to learn about code and learn about HTML and CSS.</p>
	
	<h2>Notepad++</h2>
	<a target="blank" href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">
	<img src="note.png" height="250"></a>
<p>Notepad++ is the first real form of free coding we did. We wgot the application, and created a website on our computer, accesible only to us. We switched the files over to github once we got our sealegs up in these terms.</p>
