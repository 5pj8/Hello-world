	<p>All this page will be about will be the projects we've been doing all year.<br>Some of these include Kan Acadamy, light bot, and many more<p />
	
	<h2>Khan Academy</h2>
	<img src="khan.jpg" height=400/>
	<p>One of the projects we did this year was coding using Khan acadamy. We used Khan acadamy to teach us simple code.<br>
	This information was later used to make this website. We also used that information on our Notepad ++ project that wasw also to help make this website.<p/>
	
	
	<h2>App Inventor</h2>
	<a target="blank" href="http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/">
	<img src="appinventor.png" height=400></a>
	<p>We did App Inventor which is block coding. I made an app for an Android device that taught kids how to count. It was an easy assignment that was used for small kids.</p>
	
	
	<h2>Notepad++</h2>
	<a target="blank" href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">
	<img src="notepadd++.jpg" height=400></a>
	<p>Notepad++ the first real coding language we used. We used the application to create a website accesible only to us. Once we were finished we switched the files over to GitHub and the website went online.</p>

	<h2>GitHub</h2>
	<a target="blank" href="http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/">
	<img src="github.png" height=400></a>
	<p>GitHub is a website to help people create and host websites. GitHub is how we put our website on the internet. We did this towards the end of the year.</p>
	
	<h2>Canopy</h2>
	<a target="blank" href="https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/">
	<img src="canopy.jpg" height=400></a>
	<p>Canopy is a program that is used to code in Python. We used it to make a few games, which i will present as the next assignment in this portfolio. We made a guessing game and a hangman game, with presentations for both.</p>

	
	<h2>Repl.it</h2>
	<a target="blank" href="https://repl.it/">
	<img src="replit.png" height=400></a>
	<p>After using Canopy to make games, we switched to Replit and made an account. Replit let us go online and share with a group member without needing to share a flashdrive.</p>

	<h2>Guess Game in Canopy</h2>
	<a target="blank" href="https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/">
	<img src="guessinggame.jpg" height=400></a>
	<p>The guessing game that we made in canopy was our first real test, where we combined what nwe learned in Khan Academy. We had to present to the class, and that also helped me get some confidence.</p>

	
	<h2>Repl.it Story</h2>
	<a target="blank" href="https://repl.it/">
	<img src="outline for story.jpg" height=400></a>

	<a target="blank" href="https://repl.it/">
	<img src="story itself in replit.PNG" height=400></a>
	<p>Our last project was to create an interactive story using  Repl.it. We created the story, then put that neatly into a flow chart. Then we did the coding and finished the end of our story. I think ours turned out well.</p>
