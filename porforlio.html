	<p>One of the projects we did this year was coding using Khan acadamy. We used Khan acadamy to teach us simple code.<br>
	This information was later used to make this website. We also used that information on our Notepad ++ project that wasw also to help make this website.<p/>

<p>App Inventor is a website where you can create apps for android devices. The app I created was an app about learning how to count. It was centered around kids in kindergarten and younger, and it was a fun project. It was a sort of brick building system, with some code still associated.</p>
